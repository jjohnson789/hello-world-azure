    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">My name is Jaylen Johnson and I am a senior aviation administration student here at Lewis. I was born in San Jose California and raised in the town of El Dorado Hills.
	<br>Over the summer I worked at my local movie theater where I had a multitude of responsibilites, everything from selling tickets to cleaning theaters. The job also came with 
    <br> great benifits including free movie tickets and half off all concession items. The best part of the job though was having the opportunity to work with some great coworkers.
    <br> In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, video games, wathcing movies, traveling, the outdoors, and flying.
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>  
<p><ul style="list-style-type: square; text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
    <li>Understanding of website managment and design </li>
    <li>Greater knowledge of programing</li>
    <li>Better file managment skills</li></ul>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">In my free time I really enjoy traveling and flying to different places with friends and family. I currently have my private pilots license so I am able to fly myself and 
        <br> others to differnt places around california. It's always fun sharing my love of aviaiton and let people experince the same feeling I do everytime I go up. Over thanksgiving and winter 
        <br> break I plan to go flying and take friends and family to Oceano Airport (L52) which is an aiport right next to the beach in Southern California.
